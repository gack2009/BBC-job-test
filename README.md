The software really easy to use
there are three buttons:
-start: to create the game of life and run the algorithm
-step: to puase the game and move frame by frame every time you press on the step button
-puase: to pause the game
-Manual: to start a manual game of life meaning the game would not automaticly move you have to press on manual or step to view the next step.

when start pressed it runs the algorithm and shows the result on the grid box
